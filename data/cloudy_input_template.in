# Abundances can be defined element by elemenet or using templates
# for approx known conditions (e.g primordial, hii region [no grains], ...)
# (no grains): no metal depletion
abundances solar_GASS10 no grains

# Use Orion-type grains of x0.2 the size (use dust depletion)

# Poly-Aromatic Carbons in the grains x0.2 the size

# Pressure will be constant within each zone

# turns on energy deposition and ionization due to relativistic particles
# The first number is the log of the cosmic ray density (n(cr), cm-3).
# The second optional number is a power-law index Î±, describing the variation of the cosmic ray

# Stopping criteria for the simulation:
# AV stops at given visual extinction

# temperature stop criteria defaults to 4000 k, here we turn it off
stop temperature off

# This sets the default limit to the number of zones that will be computed (default is 1400)
# another command to use is stop zone, which prints warning if it gets reached

# This is a special form of the iterate command in which the code will continue to iterate until the
# optical depths have converged or a limit to the number of iterations has been reached.

# CLOUDY will normally print the intensities of all emission lines with intensities greater than 10e-3
# of the reference line, which is usually H-beta, If no numbers are entered, but the keyword off appears then all lines are printed, even
# those with zero intensity.
