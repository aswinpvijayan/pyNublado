# Installation
pyNublado manages the creation of input scripts for Cloudy runs, their execution, and parsing of the resulting outputs. This installation guide has two steps: installing CLOUDY and installing pyNublado

## Requirements
 * Python 3.7 or newer
 * Your favourite C++ compiler to build Cloudy


## Installing CLOUDY
Instructions from [the Cloudy wiki](https://gitlab.nublado.org/cloudy/cloudy/-/wikis/DownloadLinks):

* Download the latest Cloudy version
```bash
  wget https://data.nublado.org/cloudy_releases/c17/c17.03.tar.gz --no-check-certificate
```
* Unpack the files 
```bash
 tar xvfz c17.03.tar.gz
```
* Move the extracted Cloudy folder to where you want it to live, e.g. your home directory 
```bash
  mv c17.03 ~/c17.03
```
* Navigate to the source folder 
```bash
  cd c17.03/source
```
* Build the executable 
```bash
  make
```
  
Once installed, you can test whether the installation was successful:
* Run the executable
```bash
 ~/c17.02/source/cloudy.exe
```  
* Type "test" then press ```Enter``` **twice**
* Cloudy should print some output, which ends with "Cloudy exited OK"


## Installing pyNublado

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash 
   git clone https://github.com/raulorteg/pyNublado
   ```

2. Install all dependencies, either via **pip** or **conda**

### pip
* Create virtual environment:
    * Update pip ``` python -m pip install pip --upgrade ```
    * Install ``` virtualenv ``` using pip ``` python -m pip install virtualenv ```
    * Create Virtual environment ``` virtualenv pynublado ```
    * Activate Virtual environment (Mac OS/Linux: ``` source pynublado/bin/activate ```, Windows: ``` pynublado\Scripts\activate ```)
    * Note: to deactivate environmet run ``` deactivate ```
* Install requirements on the Virtual environment ``` python -m pip install -r requirements.txt ```

### conda
In an existing Anaconda (or Miniconda) environment the requirements can be installed like so:
* ```bash
  conda config --add channels conda-forge
  ```
* ```bash
  conda install --yes --file requirements_conda.txt
  ```
